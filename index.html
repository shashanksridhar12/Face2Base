								<p>A few months ago, a close friend's grandma was diagnosed with dementia. While its hard to believe it is common, over 47 million people in the world suffer from this disorder. In fact, every year, ten million people are added to this number. While our friend's grandma is happy as she could be, so much is lost through her inability to communicate the same way with others.</p>
								<p>The number one symptom of dementia and alzheimer's is memory loss. It directly leads to a unstable realtionship with those they love. People who suffer this symptom simply cannot sustain the same relationships as before.

									<p>Hearing reports about harassment in different areas in California, I feel as if I am not safe in any area. Last week, I finished working out at the gym, and as I was walking home, I kept on looking back with my flashlight, just to make sure I was safe. I really wish I would not have to worry about my own safety.</p>

									<p>“One day, as I was walking in Oakland for a concert, I walked by a group of men who were saying inappropriate things about my body. I felt very scared, and did not have anyone to help me. This application has helped increase my insecurity when I walk outside now, in neighborhoods I used to feel were not safe.”</p>
